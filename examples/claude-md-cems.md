# CEMS Memory System

This project uses CEMS for persistent memory. Use these MCP tools:

- `memory_search` - Search before starting any task
- `memory_add` - Store learnings and decisions
- `memory_forget` - Remove outdated information

Always check memory first when:
- Starting a new task
- Debugging an issue
- Making architecture decisions
- Unsure about conventions
