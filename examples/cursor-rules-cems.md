# CEMS Memory Integration

IMPORTANT: Use CEMS MCP tools to search memory FIRST before starting any task.

## When to Search Memory

- Before coding: Search for relevant patterns, conventions, preferences
- Before debugging: Search for similar issues and solutions  
- After learning something: Store it with `memory_add` for future reference
- For team knowledge: Use `memory_add` with scope="shared"

## Example Queries

- "authentication patterns"
- "database conventions"
- "testing preferences"
- "API error handling"

Always check memory when:
1. Starting a new feature - search for architecture patterns
2. Debugging - search for similar error patterns
3. Code review - search for team conventions
4. Uncertain about approach - search for past decisions

## Usage

Copy this file to `.cursor/rules/cems.md` in your project (or add to your global Cursor rules) to ensure the AI proactively uses CEMS memory.
